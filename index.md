## 💼 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Network Meta Analysis on Chronic Migraine Treatments
Performed Network Meta Analysis to ompare the efficacy of Galcanezumab versus key comparators in reducing monthly migraine days in
patients with chronic migraine.

**Tools:** R, Rmd, netmeta, LaTex, EDA  
**Highlights:**
- Rank treatments based on relative effectiveness using network-derived estimates.
- Assess the certainty of evidence supporting treatment comparisons through the evaluation of network
consistency and heterogeneity

**Results:** From the forest plot comparing all treatments versus Galcanezumab (random effects model), we can conclude that Galcanezumab demonstrated statistically significant superiority only versus placebo. All active treatments achieved reductions exceeding the 2-day threshold generally considered clinically meaningful for chronic migraine prevention.
