## ðŸ’¼ Featured Projects

### ðŸ”¹ Network Meta Analysis on Chronic Migraine Treatments
**Objective:** Compare the efficacy of Galcanezumab versus key comparators in reducing monthly migraine days in patients with chronic migraine.

**Tools & Packages:** R, Rmd, netmeta, LaTex, EDA  
**Highlights:**
- Rank treatments based on relative effectiveness using network-derived estimates.
- Assess the certainty of evidence supporting treatment comparisons through the evaluation of network
consistency and heterogeneity

**Results:** From the forest plot comparing all treatments versus Galcanezumab (random effects model), we can conclude that Galcanezumab demonstrated statistically significant superiority only versus placebo. All active treatments achieved reductions exceeding the 2-day threshold generally considered clinically meaningful for chronic migraine prevention.

### ðŸ”¹ Stochastic Coordinate Descent for Missing Data with Mean Imputation
Co-authored publication in SIURO on a novel technique for solving large-sclare linear systems with missing data.  
**Objective:** As big data problems become more prevalent, the need to accurately approximate solutions to largescale linear systems increases. We propose a model that adapts Stochastic Coordinate Descent (SCD) to handle missing data in linear systems and utilizes Âµ-imputation to retrieve a better approximation of the original data. We prove that in expectation, our proposed algorithm, Âµ-imputation mSCD utilizes an unbiased estimator of the gradient of the least-squares objective function when using mean imputation in the absence of data. Furthermore, we compare our algorithmâ€™s performance on synthetic data to closely related algorithms: zero-imputation mSCD and SCD. Finally, we apply Âµ-imputation mSCD on real-world data to demonstrate the usefulness and viability of our proposed algorithm.

**Tech:** Python, MATLAB, Linear Algebra, Optimization, Stochastic Methods, Iterative Algorithms, Statistical Assumptions
